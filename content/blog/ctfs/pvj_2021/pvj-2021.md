# Pros vs Joes - BSides Deleware
Pro's vs Joe's is a team based live-combat capture the flag event that is regularly held as apart of BSides events. The CTF was live for over 36 hours with each team being comprised of a mixture of Joes (average users) and a few Pros as team capitains. 
<!--more--> 
Due to Covid-19 it was an online only event, our team the 'Keyboard **Bash**ers' had players participating from Australia, Japan and The United States.

### Preparation
A couple of weeks before the event we were granted access to the ProsvsJoes Slack channel and began communicating amongst our team. We had 2 online meetings where we devised plans, we also had a spreadsheet created by our team capitain(s) where we would store a variety of information including:  
- Public SSH Keys - These were added to a single file for easy transfer to hosts in our teams environment. A SHA-sum was used to verify the integrity of the file.  
- Fresh Passwords - A list of fresh passwords that once used we could add the corresponding host to the spreadsheet.  
- Desired Roles / Experience - We were asked what we had experience in and what our preferred role for the CTF would be.  
- Availability - Due to the duration of the event we were asked to confirm our availability over the weekend.

### The CTF
Kicking off at approximately 4AM (ACST) which equates to approximately 10AM in Deleware, it was an early morning start. This CTF is divided up into various sections to give teams a chance, the red-cell has already compromised our assets and has backdoor access.  

**First 6 Hours**  
The team began by gaining access to our infrastructure via the Proxmox Dashboard we began by changing all of the passwords for each service &  user on the operating system. We then began to patch the OS, installed applications and services and where possible hardened the configuration to reduce the attack surface..  

**Red Cell Inbound**  
After the initial period of familiarising ourselves with the hosts in our teams network the red-cell began their attack. As the red cell had already compromised our environment prior to the game commencing it didn't take long for their presence to be known. 
Whilst our team fared better than others, within an hour some of our hosts were firing off beacons to the CTF scorebot.  

**Atacking Other Teams**  
On the second day of the event we were able to begin attacking the 3 other teams in-game assets. Prior to the event, our team had discussed the idea of using executable files rather than relying solely on cron jobs or powershell. Myself and another player independently created our own beacons for the game and this worked a treat and our beacons went largely undetected. 
Our team took turns in attacking the others with 3 or 4 players assuming attacking roles while the others focussed on defending our teams assets. 

**Scorched Earth**  
For the final 2 hours of the game the rules are even further relaxed and teams can now go 'scorched earth' on the opposing teams. 
This would generally involve rendering hosts inacessable, removing core files, OS components and services.  

**The Outage**  
During the event, conveniently during the day in Australia we lost access to our Proxmox cluster due to a high-availability misconfiguration.  
Due to the timing of the outage in the US, we were unable to get in contact with anyone who had administrative access to investigate and restore our cluster. When it was eventually restored we received a points boost to account for the time our hosts were unavailable.

You can see from the red squares and hazard symbol next to each host, all of our assets are down.
