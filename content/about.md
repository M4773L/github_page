# Hello World  
Passionate about all things IT i was in need of a career change. In 2020 I undertook and completed a Certificate IV in Cyber Security at TAFESA.   
The course was great and covered the foundational skills for each of the core roles that fall under the cyber security umbrella. 
My favourite course topic was penetration testing where we covered red-teaming techniques, enumeration of targets, network and OS / Service pen-testing 
in our own GNS3 virtualised lab environment.   

My goal with this site is to provide knowledge and help to educate others passionate about IT, but in particular the cyber security aspect of things. 
If you are a prospective employer welcome to my site, please take a look around. (The [**Blog**](/blog) has most of the content linked.)
